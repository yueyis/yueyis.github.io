## git reset

To review, `git reset` is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo.
#### Use Case

Below are the 2 use cases for git rm.

| Case                                                               | Command                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Reset at commit level | git reset COMMIT |
| Reset at file level | git reset FILES |


Besides, there are 3 common options.

| Option | Meaning |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --soft | The -foption is used to override the safety check that Git makes to ensure that the files in HEAD match the current content in the staging index and working directory. |
| --mixed | The "dry run" option is a safeguard that will execute the git rm command but not actually delete the files. Instead it will output which files it would have removed. |
| --hard | The separator option is used to explicitly distinguish between a list of file names and the arguments being passed to git rm. This is useful if some of the file names have syntax that might be mistaken for other options. |
